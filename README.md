# tamarin
A little Swift CLI program that makes it easier to work with the Tamarin cable. Pretty easy to understand - put the binary in $path and run.
By default it uses /dev/tty.usbmodem313371 (interface) and /dev/tty.usbmodem313374 (monitor). You can set your own in the likely event it's different for your cable.
